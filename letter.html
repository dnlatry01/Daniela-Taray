<h1>Christmas Letter</h1>
<h3>Dear Mom,<br>
I hope you are doing well and feeling happy. As I write this, I’m thinking about how much you mean to me. It’s hard to put into words, but I will try because you deserve to know.</h3>

<h3>Thank you for always being there for me, supporting me, and cheering me on. From when I was little to now, your love and care have been the reason for so many good things in my life. You’ve taught me to be kind, patient, and to always try my best.</h3>

<h3>I’m amazed by how strong and selfless you are. You face hard times with a smile and always put our family first, even if it’s not easy for you. Your hugs make me feel safe, your words make me feel better, and your laughter makes me happy.There are so many things I love about you: how you always know when something is wrong, how you make any day better with a meal or a kind word, and the stories you tell that show your strength and wisdom.</h3>

<h3>Mom, I don’t say this enough, but I love you so much. You are my hero, my role model, and my best friend. Thank you for everything you do and for being you. I’m so proud to be your child, and I hope I make you proud too.</h3>

<h3>With all my love,<br>
Daniela</h3>
